Additional details:
The program is implemented according to the instruction. Build the source code by commanding ‘make’. Run it by commanding ‘java Interpreter < inputfile > outputfile’

Design information:
The system is mainly composed of three components: Analyzer, Parser and Printer. Analyzer is responsible for reading characters from stdin and providing Tokens to Parser when it asks. Parser is responsible for building binary trees that capture the structure of an S-expression. Printer is responsible for printing out binary tress.

Regarding the binary tree, each node of trees is a Node which can have two child Nodes. For leaves of trees, these nodes will contain atoms. Also, each node will have a variable named isList to mark whether this node is a list or not. If all of the inner nodes of a binary tress are lists, then this tree is considered as a list. Otherwise, the binary tree will be considered as a node. The output of binary trees differ between lists or nodes.
