Additional details:
The program is implemented according to the instruction. Build it by using ‘make’, and run it by using ‘java Interpreter < inputfile > outputfile’.

Design information:
The system is mainly composed of three components: Analyzer, Parser and Printer. Analyzer is responsible for reading characters from stdin and providing Tokens to Parser when it needs. Parse is responsible for building a binary tree which captures the structure of an S-expression. Printer is responsible for printing out binary trees.

Regarding a binary tree, each node of the tree is a Node which itself can have two child Nodes. For the leaves of the tree, these nodes will contain Tokens which are Atoms. In addition, each node contains a variable named isList to distinguish whether the tree is a node or a list. A tree can be considered as a list, only when all of its inner nodes are lists. Otherwise, it will be a node. The output behaviors differ between nodes and lists.
